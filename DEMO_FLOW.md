# AI Linear Algebra Tutor - Demo Flow

## üéØ **Demo Scenario: Student Learning Vector Operations**

### **Step 1: Student Asks a Question**
- **Student**: "Can you explain how to add two vectors?"
- **Interface**: Student uses voice input or types in the conversational UI
- **AI Response**: "Great question! Let me show you how vector addition works..."

### **Step 2: Tutor Explains + Draws**
- **AI Explanation**: 
  - "Vector addition follows the parallelogram rule"
  - "We add corresponding components: (a‚ÇÅ, a‚ÇÇ) + (b‚ÇÅ, b‚ÇÇ) = (a‚ÇÅ+b‚ÇÅ, a‚ÇÇ+b‚ÇÇ)"
- **Visual Demonstration**: 
  - AI generates animated shapes on whiteboard
  - Shows two vectors with arrows
  - Draws the resultant vector
  - Displays the mathematical notation

### **Step 3: Student Answers Practice Problem**
- **AI**: "Now try this: Add vectors (3, 4) and (1, 2)"
- **Student**: "The answer is (4, 6)"
- **AI Evaluation**: 
  - ‚úÖ "Correct! You added the components perfectly"
  - Updates progress tracking
  - Generates next adaptive question

### **Step 4: Tutor Adapts Based on Performance**
- **If Student Struggles**: 
  - "Let's try a simpler example with smaller numbers"
  - Generates easier practice problems
  - Focuses on basic concepts
- **If Student Excels**:
  - "Excellent! Let's try vector subtraction next"
  - Advances to more complex topics
  - Introduces 3D vectors
