In 2D, we write them as (x, y), like (3, 4) meaning 'go 3 units right and 4 units up'. Would you like me to show you how to add vectors or calculate their length?",
      intermediate: "Vectors are the building blocks of linear algebra! They can be added together, scaled up or down, and we can find angles between them. The dot product tells us about the relationship between vectors, while the cross product (in 3D) creates a new vector perpendicular to both. What specific vector concept would you like to explore?",
      advanced: "Vectors form the foundation of vector spaces and linear transformations. They can be represented in different bases, undergo coordinate transformations, and extend to infinite-dimensional function spaces.

Matrix multiplication follows specific rules - it's like a dance between rows and columns. The determinant tells us if a matrix can be 'undone' (inverted). What matrix operation are you curious about?",
